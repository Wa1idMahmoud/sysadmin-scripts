# Sysadmin Scripts

A collection of scripts that I made to automate or simplify IT tasks.

## Getting Started

This github repository is divided into three categories: `Linux`, `Windows` and `Networking`. Each category stores scripts related to topic or/and platform that the script should be used.

**Short explanation for each respective category:**

- `Windows` category holds scripts and tools to be used on Windows Platform (Mostly Window Server);
- `Networking` category holds scripts to automate network appliances deployment (like MikroTik Devices);
- `Linux` category holds scripts and tools to be used on Linux systems (Some script may work only on selected platforms).
